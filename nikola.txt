Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856 - 1943) made dozens of breakthroughs
in the production, transmission and application of electric power.
He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and
transmission technology. Though he was famous and respected, he was never able to translate
his copious inventions into long-term financial success-unlike his early employer and chief rival,
Thomas Edison. Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother
managed the family's farm. In 1863 Tesla's brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident.
The shock of the loss unsettled 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions - the first
signs of his lifelong mental illnesses.
