Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847 in Milan, Ohio;
the seventh and last child of Samuel and Nancy Edison.
When Edison was seven his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan.
Edison lived here until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen.
Edison had very little formal education as a child, attending school only for a few months.
He was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, but was always a very curious child
and taught himself much by reading on his own. This belief in self-improvement
remained throughout his life. Edison began working at an early age, as most boys did at the time.
At thirteen he took a job as a newsboy, selling newspapers and candy on the local
railroad that ran through Port Huron to Detroit. He seems to have spent much of his free
time reading scientific, and technical books, and also had the opportunity at this time to
learn how to operate a telegraph. By the time he was sixteen, Edison was proficient enough to
work as a telegrapher full time.
